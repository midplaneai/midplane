// single-region binding customer.ts uses: auth data is region-resident, never
// central. Region routing itself does NOT live in the session — it's a
// separate signed cookie — so the regional DB choice stays decoupled from auth.
//
// Construction is LAZY (getAuth) so importing this module is side-effect-free:
// bootRegion()/getDb() only run when a request actually reaches /api/auth/*,
// never at `next build` or module-eval (getDb throws when DATABASE_URL_<REGION>
// is unset, which is the normal state during build and in some dev/test runs).
//
// Foundation only: this stands the instance up ALONGSIDE the still-live Clerk
// integration. Swapping middleware / provider / sign-in pages onto it — and
// wiring the per-plan seat cap (organization.membershipLimit is static, not
// per-plan) — are later steps.
