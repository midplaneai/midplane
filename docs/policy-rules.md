# Policy rules

OSS Midplane ships four policy rules. The `table_access` rule is YAML-
driven; the rest are hardcoded. Approvals (Slack-bot, web queue,
escalation) are a Cloud feature, not OSS.

## `table_access` (default: ON)

Per-table read/write policy. Each referenced table resolves to one of:

- `deny` — neither read nor write
- `read` — SELECT allowed; any write denied
- `read_write` — both allowed

A query is denied if **any** referenced table fails its required
permission. Reads must satisfy `read` or `read_write`; writes must
satisfy `read_write`. The walk is AST-recursive — writes hidden in
CTEs / subqueries / UNION arms / JOINs are detected at the inner
write node and checked against that target's permission.

Out of the box (no YAML), the rule's default is deny-all-writes:
every SELECT allows, every write denies. To grant per-table writes,
mount a YAML policy file via `MIDPLANE_POLICY_FILE`:

```yaml
table_access:
  default: read           # default for tables not listed below
  tables:
    users:            read
    posts:            read
    audit_log:        deny
    webhooks:         read_write
    feature_flags:    read_write
    "stripe.charges": read    # schema-qualified key, matched first
```

Schema resolution mirrors how Postgres's default search_path
(`"$user", public`) resolves bare names. Lookup order:

1. Schema-qualified ref (`FROM stripe.charges`) → try `stripe.charges` key.
2. Bare ref (`FROM users`) → try `public.<name>` (`public.users`) before
   the bare key, so policies in canonical schema-qualified form match
   agent SQL that uses bare names.
3. Bare key (`users`) — matches bare refs and any schema-qualified ref
   whose qualified key is absent from policy.
4. Otherwise `default`.

`default: deny` blocks reads and writes on every unlisted table.

The bare → `public.<name>` fallback assumes Postgres actually resolves
bare refs to `public`. To make this a hard guarantee instead of a guess,
`PgPoolExecutor` pins every connection's search_path to `public,
pg_catalog` via the libpq `options` startup parameter, and `SET`
(`VariableSetStmt`) is denied unconditionally so agent SQL can't
rewrite search_path on a pooled connection. Tables outside `public`
must be referenced with schema-qualified names in both policy and SQL
(`FROM app_data.users` + `app_data.users: read`); bare refs always
resolve to `public`.

Examples:

```sql
-- with the YAML above:
SELECT * FROM users                                          -- ALLOW (read)
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 1                               -- DENY  (users is read)
INSERT INTO feature_flags (name) VALUES ('beta')             -- ALLOW (feature_flags is read_write)
WITH x AS (DELETE FROM users RETURNING *) SELECT * FROM x    -- DENY  (recursive catch on inner DELETE)
INSERT INTO webhooks (msg) SELECT msg FROM audit_log         -- DENY  (audit_log read denies)
SELECT * FROM audit_log                                      -- DENY  (deny)

-- with no YAML (legacy default):
DELETE FROM anywhere                                         -- DENY  (no table is read_write)
SELECT * FROM anywhere                                       -- ALLOW (default = read)
```

> **Approvals don't ship in OSS.** OSS denial returns a structured MCP
> error; the agent reads the reason and pivots. Slack-bot / web-queue
> approval workflows are a Midplane Cloud feature on top of the same
> engine — same policy YAML, plus humans in the loop.

## `multi_statement` (default: ON)

Denies any query whose AST contains more than one top-level statement. Catches the Datadog Security Labs SQLi vector against the deprecated Anthropic Postgres MCP.

```sql
SELECT 1                                                   -- ALLOW (1 statement)
SELECT 1;                                                  -- ALLOW (trailing semicolon, 1 statement)
SELECT 1; DROP TABLE users;                                -- DENY (2 statements)
```

## `tenant_scope` (default: OFF; opt-in per customer)

Denies queries on tenant-scoped tables that lack a literal `WHERE {column} = {context.tenant_id}` predicate at the same scope.

Conservative semantics: subqueries, CTEs, UNION arms, JOINs, and function calls all enforced. Some legitimate queries may be denied (false positives possible; we'll keep refining the matcher).

### Strict mode (0.5.0+, recommended)

Set a universal `column` and every queried table is tenant-scoped unless you say otherwise. The dangerous path — a forgotten table that silently leaks — is named (`exempt`), not the default.

```yaml
tenant_scope:
  enabled: true
  column: tenant_id        # universal tenant column
  overrides:               # tables that use a different column
    orders: org_id
  exempt:                  # tables that intentionally don't filter
    - audit_log
    - regions
```

Lookup order per queried table:

1. `exempt[table]` ⇒ table is not scoped. Most explicit signal wins.
2. `overrides[table]` ⇒ table is scoped on the override column.
3. `column` ⇒ table is scoped on the universal column.

If none match (no `exempt`, no override, and `column` is unset), the table isn't checked — that's the legacy `mappings`-only behavior below.

> The engine does **no schema introspection**. The rule's job is to check that the AST carries `WHERE <column> = <tenant_id>` at every scope where a scoped table appears. If your agent issues `WHERE tenant_id = 42` against a table without a `tenant_id` column, Postgres surfaces the column-missing error — the operator's cue to mark that table `exempt` or add an `overrides` entry.

> `information_schema` is **always exempt** — the canned `list_tables` and `describe_table` tools need it under strict mode, same as the existing `table_access` carve-out. `pg_catalog` is not exempt; if your agent needs to read it, list specific tables under `exempt`.

### DML semantics

`tenant_scope` checks writes the same way it checks reads, plus an additional rule for `INSERT`:

| Statement | What's checked |
|---|---|
| `SELECT` | Every scoped table in `FROM`/joins/subqueries/CTEs/UNION arms needs the predicate at its own scope. |
| `UPDATE` / `DELETE` | The target table (and any `FROM`/`USING` join tables) need the predicate in the `WHERE` clause. `UPDATE t SET ... WHERE t.tenant_col = <ctx>` allows; bare `UPDATE t SET ...` denies. |
| `INSERT … VALUES` | The column list must explicitly include the tenant column, and every row's literal at that position must equal `ctx.tenant_id`. `INSERT INTO t (tenant_id, ...) VALUES (42, ...)` allows; omitting the column, omitting the value, or wrong-tenant literal denies. |
| `INSERT … SELECT` | Conservative deny on the scoped target — the inserted rows depend on the SELECT's output, which we can't statically verify column-by-column. |
| `INSERT … ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` | Conservative deny — the update path can rewrite rows that don't match the VALUES check. `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` is fine. |
| `MERGE` | Conservative deny on the scoped target. Operators who need MERGE must list the table under `exempt`. |

### Legacy mode (`mappings`, pre-0.5.0)

```yaml
tenant_scope:
  enabled: true
  mappings:                # alias for `overrides`; deprecated
    users:    org_id
    posts:    org_id
    invoices: customer_id
```

Without `column` set, only tables listed in `mappings` (alias for `overrides`) are checked. **Tables you forget to list are not scoped** — this is the footgun strict mode closes. Existing 0.4.x configs continue to work; the alias is accepted and will be removed in a later release.

`mappings` and `overrides` in the same document are rejected — `mappings` is the pre-0.5.0 alias for `overrides`, so picking both is a configuration bug.

### Migration

Adding a `column:` to an existing config will likely deny some queries that worked before — anywhere an agent touched a table that was previously unlisted. That's the point: those queries were unscoped. Expect a one-time pass to:

- Add genuinely tenant-free tables to `exempt` (audit logs, region/lookup tables).
- Add tables that use a non-default column to `overrides`.
- Update agent SQL to include the predicate everywhere else.

Per-session: set `MIDPLANE_TENANT_ID=42` in env vars. Hosted: `tenant_id` claim on the issued MCP token.

## `parse_error` (default: ON, implicit)

Denies any input that fails to parse. `libpg_query` is the parser. Anything that looks like a string but isn't valid Postgres SQL is denied.

## What isn't a policy rule (OSS)

- "Approval flow" — humans-in-the-loop approvals are a Midplane Cloud feature; OSS Midplane is policy-as-YAML only.
- "Limit row count" — `LIMIT` clause not enforced. Long-term roadmap.
- "Match against a SQL pattern" — explicitly rejected. Regex-on-SQL is the anti-pattern Midplane fights.
- "Approve based on time-of-day / business hours" — later roadmap.
- "Prevent specific column reads" — later roadmap (fine-grained schema-aware policy).
